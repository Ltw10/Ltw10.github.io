  <h1> <br /> Friends </h1>
    <p> <br /> I've made many friends throughout my life. I have some from high school and some I've met at college. All of these people play a special role in my life. I will include some pictures below. </p>

  <h1> <br /> Things I Love </h1>
    <h2> University of Kentucky </h2>
      <p> One of my favorite things is the University of Kentucky. I've been a Kentucky basketball and football fan for a long time. I go to school at UK and I love it even more now. UK is helping me achieve my goals and I can not thank them enough for that. </p>

    <h2> Sports </h2>
      <p> I love sports. I've had a long history with sports as I experimented with all different kinds of sports in my childhood. During high school I played 4 years of tennis and 1 year of golf. In my free time (pre-COVID) you could find me playing any type of sport. I love playing pickup basketball or touch football. I also enjoy watching sports in person or on TV. I love to play fantasy football. Any and all sports entertain me. Some of my favorite sports teams are the Kentucky Wildcats (obviously), Cincinnati Bengals, and Cincinnati Reds. </p>

    <h2> Working Out </h2>
      <p> I started working out my junior year of high school and have been in love with it ever since. I am a very competitive person so the feeling of always competing against yourself pushes me. I do not have any pictures to show my love for working out, but it does play a major role in my life. </p>
    <h2> The Lake </h2>
      <p> When I was a little kid my family would go to Lake Cumberland in Kentucky and stay at my grandma and grandpa's place. As I got older my family went to the lake every summer with our family friends. I have some of my best memories at the lake. Although it is an unpopular opinion I think I would take the lake over the beach anyday. </p>

    <h2> Video Games </h2>
      <p> I enjoy video games because the games themselves are fun, but really what makes me love video games is the time I get to spend with my friends on them. I have spent nights laughing while playing games with my friends. Videos games are one thing that really helped me get through the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
    <h2> Computer Science </h2>
      <p> When I was younger my favorite subject in school was math. Math always came easy to me and I liked how there was always a definitive answer. When I learned what coding and computer science were I really started to enjoy working on school work. Computer science is a passion of mine and I am excited to see where it might take me in my career and life. </p>
