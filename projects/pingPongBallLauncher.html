<p> During my second semester of college freshmen year a project in one of my classes was to create a mechanical ping pong ball launcher and target system to act as a toy for kids with disabilities. I worked primarily on the coding aspect of the project which dealt with using a camera to find target and distance to target. I learned how to use a neural network to train the camera to identify the target. I designed code to take the distance and compute the launch angle needed then turn the launcher towards the target and set the launch angle. I assisted in using code to light up a scoreboard based on the accuracy of the launcher. </p>
<p> *Disclaimer* This semester transitioned from in-person to online classes mid-semester due to the COVID-19 pandemic. You can imagine the struggles of trying to complete this group project while in quarantine. Our final project does not look like what we wished or thought it would look like, but I think our final project slides linked below are a testament to the work that went in regardless of if we were actually able to produce a final launcher or not.
<p> The pictures you see above are from the parts of the project that we actually were able to design and prototype while on campus that semester.
