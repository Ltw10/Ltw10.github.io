## Welcome to Luke Williams's Personal Website

My name is Luke Williams and I made this personal website as a project and also so I can link it on my resume.

I created this website using GitHub Pages and the Tactile Theme layout.

I coded this website using entirely HTML. This was my first time using HTML so there were many kinks along the way and many flaws in the website, but overall for my first 
HTML project I am happy with how it looks.

Be sure to take a look at the website using the link https://ltw10.github.io
